## 🎯 Aim
To develop a responsive and user-friendly task management web application using React, enabling users to add, view, and manage tasks efficiently with supporting informational pages like About Us and Helpline.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement a simple task management system using React components.
- Provide navigation between pages (Home, About Us, Helpline) using React Router DOM.
- Ensure a clean, responsive, and professional user interface for internship-ready submission.
- Deploy the application on Vercel for public access and easy sharing.
- Document the project clearly with a structured README for academic and professional review.
## 🛠 Software Required
- **Node.js** (v18 or later) – for running React and npm scripts
- **npm** (v9 or later) – package manager to install dependencies
- **Visual Studio Code** – recommended editor for development
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and repository hosting
- **Vercel** – for deployment and hosting the live application
## 📚 Theory
The Smart Task Manager is built using **React**, a JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces. React follows a **component-based architecture**, where the UI is divided into reusable pieces called components. 

For navigation between pages (Home, About Us, Helpline), the project uses **React Router DOM**, which enables client-side routing without reloading the page. 

The app was bootstrapped with **Create React App**, providing a ready-to-use environment with Webpack, Babel, and ESLint preconfigured. Deployment is handled via **Vercel**, a cloud platform that automates builds and hosts frontend applications globally.
## 🧩 Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudipta-Bhowmik-hub/23BAI71452-Experiment1-SudiptaBhowmik.git
   cd 23BAI71452-Experiment1-SudiptaBhowmik
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
3. **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    npm start
4. **Open the app in your browser Navigate to http://localhost:3000**
5. **Build for production (optional)**
    ```bash
    npm run build
## 🌐 Live Deployment
The Smart Task Manager app is deployed and accessible online at:  
[Live App Link](https://23-bai-71452-experiment1-sudipta-bh-xi.vercel.app/)
## 💻 Program Description
The Smart Task Manager is a React-based web application designed to simplify task management.  
It allows users to:
- Enter tasks through a text input field.
- Add tasks instantly with the "Add Task" button.
- View tasks dynamically on the Home page.
- Navigate to additional informational pages like **About Us** and **Helpline**.
